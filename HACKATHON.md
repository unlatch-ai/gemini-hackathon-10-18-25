# Live Safety Monitor - Gemini Hackathon 2025 Submission

## Project Overview

**Live Safety Monitor** is a real-time personal safety application that uses a **multi-agent Gemini AI system** to detect dangerous situations and automatically trigger emergency response through fake phone calls.

**Problem:** People in uncomfortable or dangerous situations (bad dates, harassment, coercion) often can't explicitly ask for help without escalating the danger.

**Solution:** Our multi-agent AI continuously monitors conversations, detects danger through context and emotion analysis, and automatically triggers a fake phone call as a natural escape route.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### Why Multi-Agent?

Instead of a single AI making all decisions, we use **4 specialized Gemini 2.5 Flash agents** that collaborate to analyze different dimensions of danger:

### Agent Specializations

#### Agent 1: Transcript Analyzer üìù
**Role:** Analyzes literal words and explicit content

**Detects:**
- Explicit threats or aggressive language
- Direct requests for help
- Attempts to leave or end conversation
- Mentions of danger, fear, discomfort

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
You are a TRANSCRIPT ANALYSIS AGENT. Analyze ONLY literal content:
- Explicit threats or aggressive language
- Direct requests for help
Rate danger based on LITERAL CONTENT ONLY from 0-100.
```

#### Agent 2: Emotional State Detector üò∞
**Role:** Detects emotional distress through language patterns

**Detects:**
- Signs of stress, fear, anxiety
- Nervousness or hesitation in speech
- Passive-aggressive language
- Coded distress signals

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
You are an EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS AGENT. Analyze ONLY emotional indicators:
- Signs of stress, fear, or anxiety
- Nervousness or hesitation
- Emotional distress signals
Rate danger based on EMOTIONAL STATE from 0-100.
```

#### Agent 3: Context Interpreter üîç
**Role:** Understands social dynamics and situational context

**Detects:**
- Power dynamics between speakers
- Signs of coercion or manipulation
- Social pressure or uncomfortable situations
- Situational red flags

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
You are a CONTEXT ANALYSIS AGENT. Analyze ONLY contextual factors:
- Power dynamics between speakers
- Signs of coercion or manipulation
- Social pressure or uncomfortable situations
Rate danger based on CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS from 0-100.
```

#### Agent 4: Threat Assessor (Meta-Agent) ‚öñÔ∏è
**Role:** Synthesizes all agent inputs to make final decision

**Process:**
- Receives scores from all 3 specialist agents
- Analyzes agreement/disagreement patterns
- Considers which dimensions are triggering
- Makes final threat assessment (0-100)
- Triggers emergency response if ‚â•70%

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
You are the THREAT ASSESSMENT COORDINATOR. Synthesize analysis from:
- Transcript Analysis Agent: X/100 (literal content)
- Emotional State Agent: Y/100 (emotional distress)
- Context Analysis Agent: Z/100 (situational factors)

Synthesize into final danger score considering:
- Are all agents in agreement? (high confidence)
- Is one agent detecting something others missed?
- What's the overall pattern?
```

### Benefits of Multi-Agent Approach

1. **Reduced False Positives**: Each agent specializes ‚Üí more accurate than single general-purpose AI
2. **Higher Accuracy**: Meta-agent synthesizes multiple perspectives ‚Üí catches danger signals across dimensions
3. **Explainable AI**: Users see individual agent scores ‚Üí build trust through transparency
4. **Robust Detection**: Can't miss danger if it shows up in ANY dimension (emotional, literal, or contextual)
5. **Parallel Processing**: All 3 specialist agents run simultaneously ‚Üí fast analysis

### Code Walkthrough

**Multi-Agent Implementation** ([python/live_stream_handler.py:231-396](python/live_stream_handler.py#L231-L396))

```python
async def _analyze_conversation_safety(self, conversation):
    """Multi-agent collaborative analysis system"""
    logger.info("ü§ù Starting multi-agent collaborative analysis...")

    # Run all 3 specialist agents IN PARALLEL for efficiency
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        self._agent_transcript_analyzer(conversation),
        self._agent_emotional_detector(conversation),
        self._agent_context_interpreter(conversation),
        return_exceptions=True
    )

    transcript_score, emotional_score, context_score = results

    logger.info(f"üìä Agent Scores - Transcript: {transcript_score}, "
                f"Emotional: {emotional_score}, Context: {context_score}")

    # Meta-agent synthesizes all inputs
    final_score = await self._agent_threat_assessor(
        conversation,
        transcript_score,
        emotional_score,
        context_score
    )

    return final_score, agent_breakdown
```

**Frontend Multi-Agent Display** ([components/SafetyRecorder.tsx:342-369](components/SafetyRecorder.tsx#L342-L369))

Shows all 4 agent scores in real-time for transparency:
- Transcript Agent: X%
- Emotional Agent: Y%
- Context Agent: Z%
- **Threat Assessor: FINAL%** (highlighted)

### Technology Stack

- **AI:** Gemini 2.5 Flash (4 instances per analysis)
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + WebSocket
- **Python:** aiohttp + google-genai SDK
- **Voice:** Twilio Voice API
- **Speech:** Web Speech API (browser-native)
- **Infrastructure:** ngrok for phone access

## Gemini API Usage

### 4 Gemini Instances Per Analysis

Every 10 seconds, we make **4 parallel Gemini API calls**:

1. **Transcript Analyzer**: `gemini-2.5-flash` with transcript analysis prompt
2. **Emotional Detector**: `gemini-2.5-flash` with emotional analysis prompt
3. **Context Interpreter**: `gemini-2.5-flash` with context analysis prompt
4. **Threat Assessor**: `gemini-2.5-flash` with meta-analysis prompt (receives other 3 scores)

### Why Gemini 2.5 Flash?

- **Speed**: Sub-second response time for real-time safety monitoring
- **Accuracy**: Excellent at nuanced language understanding
- **Cost-Effective**: Flash model allows 4 concurrent calls every 10s
- **Context Window**: Large enough for conversation buffer analysis

### Prompt Engineering

Each agent has a **highly specialized system instruction** that:
- Clearly defines its specific role
- Limits its analysis to one dimension only
- Requires numeric output (0-100) for meta-agent synthesis
- Prevents overlap with other agents

Example: Emotional Agent is told to **ONLY** analyze emotions, not literal content. This specialization improves accuracy.

## Demo Scenario

### Use Case: Bad Date

**Situation:** User is on a date that becomes uncomfortable. They can't explicitly say "I need help" without escalating.

**Conversation (10-second buffer):**
> "Um, I'm not really comfortable with this... can we maybe slow down? I think I should probably go soon..."

**Multi-Agent Analysis:**

| Agent | Score | Reasoning |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| üìù Transcript | 45% | Mentions wanting to leave, but polite |
| üò∞ Emotional | 75% | High nervousness, hesitation, discomfort |
| üîç Context | 80% | Power imbalance, pressure situation |
| ‚öñÔ∏è Assessor | **78%** | **Emotional + Context high ‚Üí TRIGGER** |

**Result:** Emergency call triggered at 78% confidence (‚â•70% threshold)

**Why Multi-Agent Wins:**
- Single AI might miss this (no explicit threats)
- Transcript agent alone: 45% (below threshold)
- But emotional + context agents caught the danger
- Meta-agent synthesized: "2 out of 3 agents agree = high confidence"

## Innovation & Impact

### Novel Contributions

1. **First Multi-Agent Safety System**: No existing panic button uses collaborative AI agents
2. **Emotional Intelligence**: Goes beyond keyword detection to understand feelings
3. **Context-Aware**: Understands social dynamics and power imbalances
4. **Explainable AI**: Users see exactly why the system made its decision
5. **Privacy-First**: 10-second buffers, no permanent storage

### Real-World Impact

**Target Users:**
- People on first dates (especially from dating apps)
- Individuals in uncomfortable social situations
- Anyone experiencing harassment or pressure
- People in situations where explicit help requests escalate danger

**Why It Matters:**
- **1 in 3 women** experience harassment or violence
- Traditional panic buttons are too obvious
- Many victims can't explicitly ask for help
- AI can detect danger even when victims can't say it
